# Intelligent Drawing recognition by application of machine learning
The work aims at conversion of 2D drawings of mechanical components into their 3D models without human intervention by applying Machine Learning models.

Objectives of this work is:
1. Investigating the applications of Machine Learning in recognition of 2D drawings of machine components.
2. Applying Machine learning algorithms to identify 3 to 7 sided polygons with random shapes and segmented edges.
3. Comparing performance of Machine Learning Models with the one achieved from conventional code.
4. Applying Machine Learning models and Artificial Neural Networks to identify 3D primitives from 2D drawings.
5. Extending the earlier implemented concept to distinguish 3D primitives with and without features and to identify additive primitives from 2D drawings.
6. Determining orientation of 3D primitives from 2D drawings.
